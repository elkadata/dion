AWS Security Groups act like a **firewall** for your Amazon EC2 instances controlling both **Inbound** and **outbound** traffic. When you launch an instance on Amazon EC2, you need to assign it to a particular security group.

#### Three important points about Security Groups :
- AWS Firewall Solutions
- Filters Incoming & outgoing traffic from an instance
- IP Protocols, Port and source/destination IP Addresses

#### 1. Login to your AWS Management Console → Select the EC2 service → Select “Security Groups” from under the “Network & Security” category on the left:

#### 2. Define your security group name `sec-ad`, and then assign to your **VPC** `vpc-ad` ,

>To allow ports for inbound traffic, you can add them on the **indbound** tab, and then select source anywhere `0.0.0.0/0`

####  Done !!!
